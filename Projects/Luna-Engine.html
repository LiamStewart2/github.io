                <p>This is my first attempt at building a 3D game engine using OpenGL. It is currently a work in progress, but i already have a couple features implemented forming the basis of the engine. This project is something i have wanted to commit to for a long time, and finally feel in a good position to start work on it.</p>

                        <p>Taking notes from <a href="https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/">Robert Nystroms Game Programming Patterns</a>, i wanted an ECS like system, however for sake of setting up the project, settled for a much simpler object component system, where objects own a list of components</p>
                        <p>Each update and render tick the objects are then looped through and all components they own update. This system allows quick development of new components, however i still intend on moving to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system#:~:text=Entity%E2%80%93component%E2%80%93system%20(ECS,Entity%E2%80%93Component%E2%80%93System%20layout.">traditional ECS</a> as one of my next tasks due to the significant performance improvment.</p>
