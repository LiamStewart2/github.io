                <p>This was my submition to the bespoke platform development module for year 1 of university, where we where tasked with building a cross platform game using C++ and SDL2 which would then be build onto a bespoke platform. For my game I decided to build a Space Invaders like game, with the addition of power ups. This project achieved a first class for the module.</p>

                        <p>The game was built onto an Evercade EXP, a handheld console designed for small retro games, with very specifications. This meant that throughout development I was having to take the capabilities of the device into account.</p>    
                        <p>To build my game onto the evercade, i would go through the process of pushing all code onto a linux virtual machine then onto a buildserver. I would then push the compiled files onto the evercades cartridge and SSH into the device to run the game.</p>
                        <p>This was an amazing opportunity to get hands on experience building a cross platform game. I had previously used Unities build system to build a mobile, however that abstracts most of the work from the developer, and it was nice seeing how it works behind the scene.</p>
