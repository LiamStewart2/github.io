            <div class="PP_project-description">
                <p>For this project, I volunteered, collaborating with a team of 6 developers using C++ and SFML to build an RTS game engine. I was responsible for the agents and rendering systems, working closely with the engine core to optimise and implement new features.</p>

                        <p>As this was my first group project, it was also my first time using Git's collaboration features. Our team used <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> to host the repository, with each contributor working in a separate branch.</p>
                        <p>I spent the first few weeks learning Git in-depth—getting familiar with key commands, resolving merge conflicts, and organizing branch structures for team efficiency.</p>

                        <p>My first major task was developing the agent system. The system consisted of two main parts: the agents themselves and an Agent Manager. While the implementation evolved over time, the core idea—using inheritance to represent all world entities—remained constant.</p>
                        <p>Every object in the world (trees, planes, future structures) was treated as an agent. Some could move, others were static, and each required unique behavior. To support this variety, I implemented an inheritance-based class hierarchy.</p>
                        <img src="../Assets/Photos/RTS-Agents-Diagram.png" alt="Agent inheritance diagram" />
                        <p>Agents were stored in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree">quadtree</a> structure developed by another programmer, which allowed for efficient spatial queries during rendering and updates.</p>

                        <p>I was also responsible for the isometric terrain system. While utility functions already existed to convert between world and screen space, we needed a system to associate terrain tiles in the quadtree with their texture data.</p>
                        <p>We used a combination of JSON files and a Python tool to procedurally generate maps. These files included both terrain height and type arrays.</p>
                        <p>Loading the height map:</p>
                        <img src="../Assets/Photos/heightmaploading.png" alt="Code snippet for loading terrain heights" />
                        <p>For terrain types, I used a hash map that linked terrain keys in the JSON to corresponding spritesheets, allowing flexible and extensible terrain rendering.</p>
                        <img src="../Assets/Photos/TerrainType.png" alt="Hashmap terrain type system" />
                        <p>To determine which tile to use from the spritesheet, I evaluated the height of neighboring tiles to pick the correct directional variant. Most of this logic is implemented through conditional statements.</p>
                        <img src="../Assets/Photos/directionmapcode.png" alt="Directional mapping code snippet" />
                        <p>If I were to rebuild the terrain system, I would likely switch to an orthographic 3D approach using a mesh generated from heightmaps, with texture blending for smoother terrain transitions.</p>

                        <p>As shown in the video, multiple planes follow a lead plane using a combination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A* pathfinding</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids">boids</a> behavior. While another programmer worked on pathfinding, I implemented the boids behavior.</p>
                        <img src="../Assets/Photos/boidsimplementation.png" alt="Boids implementation code" />
                        <p>The boids were implemented as specialized agents with AI logic. They followed a PathfinderAgent using simple separation, alignment, and cohesion rules.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, we ran out of development time before adding formation logic. If I continue working on the project, I'd expand the system to support formations—common in RTS games—where boids organize into predefined layouts during movement.</p>
